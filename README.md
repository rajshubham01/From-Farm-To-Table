# From-Farm-To-Table
This is a "Software Engineering &amp; Object Oriented Modelling Design" project based on the problem statement - How can technology help farmers (OR) Enabling seed to table revolution

We chose to work on the "How can tecnology help farmers?"
And we came up with a solution where the buyers and the sellers (i.e. the farmers) interact on a single platform and there is no intervention of the middle-men who take away the profits which the farmers deserve for their hardwork.
